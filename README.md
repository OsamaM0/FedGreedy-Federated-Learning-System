# GreedyReliabFL: Strengthening Federated Learning with Jaccard Greedy Selection and Blockchain Security

### Client Selection
1. **Strategy**: Jaccard Greedy Selection Strategy.
   - **Advancement**: Paradigm-shifting approach in federated learning.
   - **Key Features**: Mathematical rigor, algorithmic efficiency, robust security measures.
   - **Mechanism**: Uses Jaccard similarity for client prioritization.
   - **Benefits**: Enhances diversity and representativeness of participants, ensures integrity and reliability of FL models across distributed datasets.

### Enhancing Reliability in Federated Learning
1. **Challenge**: Ensuring reliability of participants in federated learning (FL).
2. **Solution**: Reputation-based selection scheme.
   - **Techniques**: Uses steganography to ensure integrity.
   - **Factors Considered**: Device characteristics (computational power, memory, energy), historical performance (accuracy, consistency).
   - **Security**: Incorporates verifiable random functions (VRFs) to conceal identities and enhance security.
3. **Outcome**: Enhances security and integrity of the selection process, improving overall FL reliability and effectiveness.

### Addressing Attacks in Federated Learning
1. **Challenge**: Security threats from malicious participants.
2. **Solution**: Novel approach to identify and mitigate malicious behavior.
   - **Technique**: Analyze gradient differences before and after training.
   - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to simplify gradient data.
   - **Clustering**: Groups similar updates to identify suspicious behavior.
3. **Outcome**: Effectively isolates malicious participants, enhancing security and reliability of FL.

### Defense System Against Attacks in Federated Learning
1. **Challenge**: Compromised end nodes and poisoning attacks.
2. **Solution**: Aggregation strategy with penalization mechanism.
   - **Penalization**: Regularization term in local models to penalize deviations.
   - **Objective**: Minimize strength of attacks, encourage convergence towards a common objective.
3. **Outcome**: Detects and mitigates poisoning attacks, enhances robustness and security of FL.

### Reward-Penalty Scheme
1. **Purpose**: Promote fairness and incentivize honest behavior.
   - **Mechanism**: Rewards for honest behavior, penalties for malicious activities.
2. **Outcome**: Fosters a collaborative and equitable learning environment.

### Blockchain-Based Processes
1. **Initialization**
   - **Action**: Workers and task publishers register blockchain accounts and generate unique wallet addresses.
   - **Benefit**: Facilitates secure and transparent interactions within the decentralized network.
2. **Model Retrieval**
   - **Action**: Task publisher searches blockchain for pre-trained models; if none, initiates a new FL training task via smart contract.
   - **Benefit**: Efficient model management and transaction handling.
3. **Launching FL Tasks Request**
   - **Action**: Task publisher broadcasts smart contract with FL task requirements.
   - **Details**: Includes task ID, data types, attributes, size, selection time, total points, and rewards.
   - **Worker Response**: Interested workers send data type and attribute details.
4. **Worker Selection**
   - **Action**: Task publisher identifies and assesses candidates based on reputation, skill, experience, and availability.
   - **Process**: Two steps - pre-selection based on reputation and final selection with deposit points locking.
5. **Deposit**
   - **Action**: Establish network shard and require participants to contribute deposit points.
   - **Purpose**: Ensures commitment and preparation for the training process.

### Experimental Validation
1. **Objective**: Evaluate performance of proposed mechanisms.
2. **Outcome**: Demonstrates effectiveness in enhancing reliability, security, and fairness in FL.

### Summary
- **Key Concepts**: Client selection, reliability, security, penalization, reward-penalty, blockchain-based processes, experimental validation.
- **Techniques Used**: Jaccard similarity, steganography, VRFs, PCA, clustering, regularization, smart contracts.
- **Outcomes**: Improved reliability, security, robustness, and fairness in FL.
